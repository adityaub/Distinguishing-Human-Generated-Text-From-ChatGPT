"As each new means of communication and social interaction is introduced, social customs and etiquette evolve in response.  For example, it took time before the practice of saying “hello” and identifying oneself became the universal way to initiate a phone conversation. By the 1980s, a system of topical news postings , carried on the Internet was becoming widely used in universities, the computer industry, and scientific institutions.  Many new users did not understand the system, and posted messages that were off topic.  Others used their postings as to insult or attack (“flame”) other users, particularly in newsgroups discussing perennially controversial topics such as abortion.  When a significant number of postings in a newsgroup are devoted to flaming and counter-flaming, many users who had sought civilized, intelligent discussion leave in protest.",1

One example might be computer memory modules that might act as a surrogate or extension ofhuman memory,0
the totalnumber of bits available and whether one bit is used to holdthe sign. Since all numbers are stored as binary digits,0
"A floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts.  Firstcomes the sign, indicating whether the number is negativeor positive",0
"Many objects are more elaborate or specialized variations ofmore basic objects.  For example, in Microsoft Windows thevarious kinds of dialog boxes are specialized versions of thegeneral Window class. ",0
